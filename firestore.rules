/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for livestock data within a multi-tenant application structure.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All livestock data is nested under /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/livestock/{livestockId}, ensuring a clear ownership hierarchy.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access livestock data that they own.
 * - Data related to livestock (HealthRecord, Reproduction, GrowthRecord, Pedigree) is stored directly within the Livestock document for authorization independence.
 * - Listing of livestock is restricted to the owner of the livestock.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is implicitly denormalized into the path /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/livestock/{livestockId}, allowing direct enforcement of ownership without `get()` calls. The livestockId is also implicitly denormalized into the path for the livestock document.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * This ruleset assumes that all livestock data is private and specific to a user. There are no public collections.
